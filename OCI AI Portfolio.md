# AI Services Overview
## Language

Allows you to perform sophisticated text analysis at scale.

Pre-trained models include language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, text classification, named entity recognition, and personal identifiable information detection.

Custom models can be trained for named entity recognition and text classification with domain-specific data sets. 

In text translation, neural machine translation is used to translate text across numerous languages.

## Vision

Allows you to upload images to detect and classify objects in them.

Pre-trained models perform object detection, image classification, and optical character recognition.

Custom models can perform custom object detection by detecting the location of custom objects in an image and providing a bounding box. The custom image classification builds a model to identify objects and scene-based features in an image.

## Speech

The OCI Speech service is used to convert media files to readable texts that's stored in JSON and SRT format.

## Document Understanding

Allows you to upload documents to detect and classify text and objects in them.

Tools within document understanding are as follows:-

- OCR -> Detect and recognize text in a document.
- Text extraction -> Word level and line level text and the bounding box coordinates of where the text is found.
- Key Value Extraction -> Extracts a predefined list of key value pairs of information from documents like receipts
- Table Extraction -> Extracts content and tabular format, maintaining the row and column relationship of cells
- Document Classification -> Classifies documents into different types.
## Digital Assistant

Oracle Digital Assistant is a platform that allows you to create and deploy digital assistants, which are AI-driven interfaces that help users accomplish a variety of tasks with natural language conversations.

# ML Services Overview

OCI AI services contains ways to run AI training for data scientists without need of managing infrastructure.

It contains deployment of Jupyter notebook in the cloud, with Conda to manage dependencies. The Jupyter notebooks are created inside a namespace called project.

It also contains a model catalog that can help data scientists to share their model with their team and work collaboratively.
