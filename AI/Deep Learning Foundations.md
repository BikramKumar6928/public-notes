# What is Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks to solve a task at hand. A very important quality of the ANN is that it can process raw data like pixels of an image and extract patterns from it.

# Benefits of Deep Learning

There is no need to provide them with what to look for in the data in contrast to Machine Learning where you have to specify what information should be looked at and what should be classified.

The data is understood by the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) by creating an internal representation, which is difficult to make manually.

Data Processing can be done in parallel, so large amount of data can be processed in a small amount of time.

# Deep Learning Data Types (with Examples)

- images -> Image classification, Object detection
- videos
- text -> Translate the text or detect the sentiment of a text
- audio -> Music Generation, Speech-To-Text
 
For images, applications can be , and so on. For textual data, applications are t. For audio, the applications can be , and so on.
