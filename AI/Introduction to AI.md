## Properties of text data

- The data is sequential. It means text cannot have multiple contexts going on in parallel
- The words in a text data must be broken into simpler terms called tokens so that it can be processed. The process is called tokenization.
- The sentences can be of different lengths. This is fixed by padding sentences so that they become of equal length.
- The similarity of text is found by performing dot or cosine similarity tests. This is also done through representation called embedding.
