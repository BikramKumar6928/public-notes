# Language

Allows you to perform sophisticated text analysis at scale.

Pre-trained models include language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, text classification, named entity recognition, and personal identifiable information detection.

Custom models can be trained for named entity recognition and text classification with domain-specific data sets. 

In text translation, neural machine translation is used to translate text across numerous languages.

# Vision

Allows you to upload images to detect and classify objects in them.

Pre-trained models perform object detection, image classification, and optical character recognition.

Custom models can perform custom object detection by detecting the location of custom objects in an image and providing a bounding box.
